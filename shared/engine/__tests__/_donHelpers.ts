// Test helpers for the DON-as-CardInstance refactor (2026-05-28).
//
// Before the refactor, tests set numeric DON counts directly:
//   s.players.A.donActive = 2;
//   s.players.B.leader.attachedDon = 1;
//
// After the refactor, those fields are string[] of DON instance IDs. These
// helpers pop DON instances from the donDeck and place them in the cost area
// or attach them to a target — reproducing the same effective state with
// real instance plumbing.
//
// All helpers mutate state in-place. They are test-only conveniences and
// should NEVER be imported from src/ or the engine itself.

 *  (D2 / CR §6-5-6-1). Given a state where the next `runRefresh→Draw→DON` will
 *  start `nextPlayer`'s turn N, this runs one extra full turn cycle so that
 *  same `nextPlayer` becomes active again on a turn ≥ 3, when attacks are
 *  legal.
 *
 *  Typical use after the existing `endTurn → runRefresh/Draw/Don` boilerplate:
 *
 *      s = endTurn(s);                                         // → B, turn 2

 *      s = advanceOneFullCycle(s);                             // → B, turn 4 main
 *
 *  The caller is responsible for being on a main phase when calling.
